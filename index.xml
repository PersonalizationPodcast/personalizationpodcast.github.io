&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to The Personalization Podcast! This is the show about
understanding, planning, building and analyzing personalized experiences.
I&amp;rsquo;m your host, Dave Ingram, and today we&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about Agile
Personalization, or in other words, how you can get the most out of a
personalization program and a personalization team in the least amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing personalization well is all about iterating quickly, and that&amp;rsquo;s what
this episode is about. We&amp;rsquo;ll be borrowing a lot of ideas from the software
development space, but FEAR NOT! There&amp;rsquo;s no deep, technical stuff coming
your way. These are straight forward, down to earth principles that you can
take and apply to almost any area of your life or business that needs to
be more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget, you can get to show notes at personalizationpodcast.com, and
you can send questions and feedback to @p13npodcast on Twitter or the
Personalization Podcast page on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-news:cb51fda0943db036025e1dcca5e429a3&#34;&gt;In the News&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;smart-refrigerators-http-www-cnet-com-news-touchscreen-refrigerators-and-talking-everything-at-ces-2016:cb51fda0943db036025e1dcca5e429a3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnet.com/news/touchscreen-refrigerators-and-talking-everything-at-ces-2016/&#34;&gt;Smart Refrigerators?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve heard about them for years, and there was a new one revealed last week
at CES. It&amp;rsquo;s got a pretty big touch screen that will run apps so you can look
up recipes just like people have been saying for a long time. Maybe no big deal,
but one feature that I like is that it will actually send you pictures of what&amp;rsquo;s
inside your fridge when you&amp;rsquo;re at the store so you can see what you forgot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worth the $5000 price tag? probably not, but neat none the less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with personalization? Well, CES was full of all the
other hot new gadgets from wearables to connected homes to self driving cars
which should give anyone pause who is thinking in terms of the Web and Email
only. The world is changing quickly, and if you&amp;rsquo;re creating digital experiences,
you need to be prepared for it all to be different very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;9-reasons-why-personalized-marketing-still-isn-t-accurate-http-www-informationweek-com-big-data-big-data-analytics-9-reasons-why-personalized-marketing-still-isnt-accurate-d-d-id-1323736-image-number-2:cb51fda0943db036025e1dcca5e429a3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.informationweek.com/big-data/big-data-analytics/9-reasons-why-personalized-marketing-still-isnt-accurate/d/d-id/1323736?image_number=2&#34;&gt;9 Reasons Why Personalized Marketing Still Isn&amp;rsquo;t Accurate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information Week - Lisa Morgan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Data Quality Is Poor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Isn&amp;rsquo;t Integrated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re relying too heavily on Legacy Systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re discounting internal data assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re putting too much faith in the wrong data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The analytics used are too basic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re relying too much on technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You think personalization is a marketing problem &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;customers expect personalized experiences throughout the lifetime of a relationship with a company&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Still Early Days &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;While there&amp;rsquo;s a debate about the maturity state of the technology, what&amp;rsquo;s less debated is the need for organizational change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;agile-personalization:cb51fda0943db036025e1dcca5e429a3&#34;&gt;Agile Personalization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-ideas:cb51fda0943db036025e1dcca5e429a3&#34;&gt;Key ideas:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iteration and Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infinite possibilities when it comes to things you can do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy, Goals and Initiatives .. high level and we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tasks or Stories

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where do Stories come from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritization of Stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprints or Iterations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also mentioned Facebook Planout, an open source experimentation framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of these ideas in written form, look out for a soon to be published
blog post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://acquia.com&#34;&gt;Acquia.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Episode 2: The Personalization Team</title>
      <link>http://personalizationpodcast.com/post/episode-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2016 21:53:16 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://personalizationpodcast.com/post/episode-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/241498057&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Episode 2 of The Personalization Podcast&amp;ndash;The show about understanding,
planning, building and analyzing Personalized Experiences. We talked last time
about what personalization is, so today we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about the very first
step you need to take to get started. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve buying software,
building complex infrastructure or anything of that sort. Step 1 is all about
People. In fact, thinking about what it takes to be successful in personalization,
I think there are three things that matter: People, Process and Product. The
software itself is last in line because if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the right people and
an appropriate process in place, you&amp;rsquo;ll be set up for failure no matter how
much you spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the news, in the last episode I promised a Q&amp;amp;A section, but
never gave a method to reach out. So if you want to ask questions, send feedback
or just generally get in touch, you can go to personalizationpodcast.com, or
tweet to @p13npodcast. P13n is an abbreviation for Personalization. In other words,
there&amp;rsquo;s a p, 13 more letters, then an n. It turns out personalizationpodcast is
too long for a twitter handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case Twitter isn&amp;rsquo;t your thing. You can also find the show on facebook by
simply searching for Personalization Podcast and post questions or feedback
there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-news:51ade350eab725e837a47d1a4253ca0c&#34;&gt;In the News&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-contextual-marketing-imperative-http-go-sap-com-docs-download-2015-10-3c6868f1-487c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa-pdf:51ade350eab725e837a47d1a4253ca0c&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://go.sap.com/docs/download/2015/10/3c6868f1-487c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.pdf&#34;&gt;The Contextual Marketing Imperative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper came across my Twitter feed the other day, and while it was published
in October last year, it still seems worth sharing. In fact, it was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.websitemagazine.com/content/blogs/posts/archive/2016/01/08/the-time-is-now-personalization-in-the-age-of-contextual-marketing.aspx&#34;&gt;an  infographic&lt;/a&gt; which had initially caught
my eye, which has a number of interesting statistics about personalization based
on the Forrester Survey. Some key stats follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;91% of marketers are prioritizing improving customer experience through personalization
over the next year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;66% of consumers reported that personalized offers and content has had an impact on their
decision to purchase a product or service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;44% of customers say they receive too many offers and promotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketers use an average of 15 siloed data sources, resulting in inconsistent
customer experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;algorithms-need-managers-too-https-hbr-org-2016-01-algorithms-need-managers-too:51ade350eab725e837a47d1a4253ca0c&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2016/01/algorithms-need-managers-too&#34;&gt;Algorithms need Managers, Too&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algorithms get things wrong and need management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining your goals correctly is one of the most important things that you can do, as this story illustrates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone has objectives and directives, but we also know that the end doesn’t always justify the means. We understand that there are soft (often unspoken) goals and trade-offs. We may turn down a little profit today for a gain in reputation tomorrow. We may strive for equality—even if it causes organizational pain in the short term. Algorithms, on the other hand, will pursue a specified objective single-mindedly. The best way to mitigate this is to be crystal clear about everything you want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you care about a soft goal, you need to state it, define it, and quantify how much it matters. To the extent that soft goals are difficult to measure, keep them top of mind when acting on the results from an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Google (which has funded some of our research on other topics), a soft-goal problem emerged with an algorithm that determines which ads to display. Harvard professor Latanya Sweeney unearthed it in a study. She found that when you typed names that were typically African American, like “Latanya Farrell,” into Google, you were shown ads offering to investigate possible arrest records, but not when you searched on names like “Kristen Haring.” Google’s hard goal of maximizing clicks on ads had led to a situation in which its algorithms, refined through feedback over time, were in effect defaming people with certain kinds of names. It happened because people who searched for particular names were more likely to click on arrest records, which led these records to appear even more often, creating a self-reinforcing loop. This probably was not the intended outcome, but without a soft goal in place, there was no mechanism to steer the algorithm away from it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-personalization-team:51ade350eab725e837a47d1a4253ca0c&#34;&gt;The Personalization Team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;skills-required:51ade350eab725e837a47d1a4253ca0c&#34;&gt;Skills Required&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Creatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Analysts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Technical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Personalization Owner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be a Cross Functional team as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fine if some of these people are from agencies, but the key point is that
you need to be iterative. Without iteration, you won&amp;rsquo;t see benefits quickly
enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this section in full written form, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.acquia.com/blog/how-build-successful-personalization-team/06/01/2016/3291021&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;
on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-from-agile:51ade350eab725e837a47d1a4253ca0c&#34;&gt;Learning from Agile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next episode I&amp;rsquo;ll do a breakdown of what Agile Personalization is really all about,
but the preview for today is that being Agile means iterating quickly over a lot
of ideas and properly prioritizing those ideas so that you&amp;rsquo;re doing the best
things first. On top of that, you see results quickly. Quick results mean happy
stakeholders and more success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free A/B testing! Google has A/B testing baked into Google Analytics. If you&amp;rsquo;re
looking to get a quick start into Personalization and don&amp;rsquo;t have the budget for
advanced software, check this out. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1745152?hl=en&#34;&gt;Content Experiments&lt;/a&gt; and it

      <title>Episode 1: Welcome and What is Personalization?</title>
      <link>http://personalizationpodcast.com/post/episode-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2016 21:51:19 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://personalizationpodcast.com/post/episode-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/240912763&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to the Personalization Podcast, the show about understanding, planning, creating and analyzing personalized experiences. I am your host, Dave Ingram, and I am excited to bring you this first of many episodes! Today’s show is all about defining personalization. What is it? What can you do with it? What all is involved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll also be talking a little bit about the format of this show and what you can expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also be wondering who this guy is who’s talking to you right now, so a very brief introduction. I grew up in the South, then moved to New England to be involved in building a personalization product called Acquia Lift. This show isn’t going to talk much about that product, though I may slip in an anecdote or example from it from time to time. In college I pursued degrees in music and computer science before eventually settling on political science, after which I promptly went to work in the tech field building websites. I’ve subsequently worked in both sales and in product management. I have hobbies in music and photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could either say that I’m interested in lots of subjects, or that I have a hard time keeping interest in one thing for long enough. In either case, hat’s probably why I’m so fascinated in the subject of Personalization which sits at the intersection of technology and the humanities, encompassing subjects as diverse as data science and machine learning, several branches of psychology, organizational structure and management, big data challenges, and various other technical and non-technical subjects. Many of these areas are also changing rapidly, so just trying to keep up can be an enormous challenge. So this show is going to cover pretty much anything that I feel is related in any meaningful way to building personalized experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some episodes will be just me, covering a specific topic in personalization such as building personalization teams and process ideas on how to run them, as well as tools and techniques available for doing personalization. In other episodes, I’ll be bringing on guests to talk about, again, pretty much anything related in any way to personalization, so look for experts in marketing, technology, data science, user experience research, psychology and more as the weeks roll on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to whatever the main section is, we’ll also be starting out each show with a quick look into the news to bring both breaking stories, as pointing you to other great articles, books or podcasts in this space. Then, at the end of each episode, we’ll reserve a few minutes for either a question and answer or for a Tip of the Week. Just one more little nugget until we meet again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, whether you’re building personalized experiences yourself, working with or managing someone who is, or just interested in where this field is going, I’m excited about this journey and I hope you’ll join me along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-news:2fede85e9f1a69a5f89f1b281051b3fc&#34;&gt;In the News&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2016-five-predictions-for-the-conversion-optimization-industry-http-conversion-com-blog-2016-five-predictions-for-the-conversion-optimization-industry:2fede85e9f1a69a5f89f1b281051b3fc&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://conversion.com/blog/2016-five-predictions-for-the-conversion-optimization-industry/&#34;&gt;2016: Five predictions for the conversion optimization industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Pavlovich&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have a love/hate relationship with personalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It offers a huge opportunity to companies with a strong foundation of split-testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you don’t have this foundation – if you don’t know which user segments to target, what motivates them and what stops them – then you risk forking your website and creating multiple suboptimal experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But personalization can and should be huge – both for brands and the software vendors that support them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;digital-personalization-separating-hype-from-reality-https-medium-com-blatantdigital-digital-personalization-separating-hype-from-reality-889e082ee53d-fo055nk8q:2fede85e9f1a69a5f89f1b281051b3fc&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@BlatantDigital/digital-personalization-separating-hype-from-reality-889e082ee53d#.fo055nk8q&#34;&gt;Digital Personalization, Separating Hype from Reality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How many companies out there mega million dollar budgets with teams of engineers and statisticians running experiments on details like the color or shape of a button? How many companies are selling consumer-specific products at towering scale? These case studies [about Amazon and Netflix] are not relevant for most businesses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Responsible Marketer’s Quick Start Guide to Personalization
1. Research your audience.
2. Develop Useful Segments and Personas.
3. Create Customer Journey Maps.
4. Identify Meaningful KPIs.
5. Produce Kickass Content.
6. Run Controlled Experiments.
7. Personalize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-personalization:2fede85e9f1a69a5f89f1b281051b3fc&#34;&gt;What is Personalization?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s take a moment to define what we actually mean by personalization. There are a few possible definitions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing the right content, to the right person, at the right time
Guiding an individual’s experience based on their context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either one of these works, but I like the latter. To me, the concept of personalization is really quite simple. If I know something about you that might be relevant to help me serve your needs better, then I will use that piece of information to guide you in the right direction. An example based on retail stores is in the episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contextualization vs. Personalization: semantics in my opinion but there&amp;rsquo;s some great research there that&amp;rsquo;s worth looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-context-is-available:2fede85e9f1a69a5f89f1b281051b3fc&#34;&gt;What context is available?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask them a question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Referral Source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot in all of this, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be exploring this more in future episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
